# Enterprise-Grade DevOps Project: Full-Stack Node.js CI/CD Pipeline

## Project Overview
This project showcases a **full-stack Node.js application** deployed on **AWS EC2** instances, leveraging **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning, **Jenkins** for automated CI/CD, **Docker** for containerization, and **SonarQube** for code quality monitoring. It demonstrates **enterprise-level DevOps practices**, infrastructure automation, and optimized deployment workflows.

The main goal is to establish a **reliable, scalable, and maintainable pipeline** for modern web applications, ensuring continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous monitoring.

## Key Features
- **Automated CI/CD Pipeline**: End-to-end automated deployment with Jenkins.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform scripts for provisioning AWS resources.
- **Containerization**: Docker images for consistent and portable environments.
- **Monitoring & Quality**: SonarQube for code quality, Prometheus & Grafana for system monitoring.
- **Orchestration & Stability**: Optimized deployment processes to enhance reliability.
- **Agile Practices**: DevOps methodology combined with Scrum for collaborative development.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend / Frontend**: Node.js, Express.js, React (if front-end included)
- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **CI/CD & Automation**: Jenkins, Ansible, Terraform
- **Cloud & Hosting**: AWS EC2
- **Monitoring & Quality**: SonarQube, Prometheus, Grafana
- **Methodologies**: DevOps, Agile (Scrum)
